# customer-segmentation-unsupervised-ml
📋 Project Overview

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic data. By grouping customers into meaningful clusters, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and drive sales growth.

# 🎯 Objectives

* Understand customer behavior using data.

* Apply K-Means clustering to group customers.

* Visualize clusters to gain actionable insights.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3.x

* Jupyter Notebook

* NumPy – numerical computations

* Pandas – data manipulation

* Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

* Scikit-learn – machine learning (K-Means clustering, preprocessing)

# ⚙️ Workflow

* Import Libraries – Load all required Python packages.

* Load Dataset – Import customer data (CSV or similar).

* Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, normalize/scale data.

# 🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository or download the files.

# Install required libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# 📊 Results

* Segmentation of customers into clusters based on spending score, annual income, etc.

* Visualizations showing different customer groups.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize distributions and correlations.

* Apply K-Means Clustering – Identify optimal clusters (using Elbow Method or Silhouette Score).

* Visualize Clusters – Plot clusters in 2D or 3D.

* Interpretation – Analyze customer segments for actionable insights.
